\section{Relationship to the course (3 to 4 pages)}
Summarize the themes/aspects from the lecture course which are relevant for the paper which you will discuss. 



\subsection{Van Wees}
From the slides, reading material. Van Wees first because he was most fundamental about devices? Building up towards the more advanced organic stuff from Loi (as in the article).



\subsection{Loi}
The Organic and optoelectronic part of the lecture is of most relevance to the paper. After the introduction into (inorganic) Light Emmitting Transistors the paper focuses on organic devices. 

\subsubsection{Tunability}
\subsubsection{Easy and low-cost production}
\subsubsection{Other differences between organic and inorganic devices}
-Mobility of charge
-Lower efficiency for organic devices
From the slides, reading material.



\subsection{Tamalika}
Perhaps some historical perspective?
