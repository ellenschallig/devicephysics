\section{Introduction}
Field-effect transistors are emerging as useful devices for efficient light generation from inorganic semiconductors, carbon nanotubes and organic thin films. In this progress article, the focus lies on organic light-emitting field-effect transistors and the role played by the material properties, device features and the active layer structure in determining device performance.

Since the separate discoveries of the field-effect transistor (FET) in the early 20th century, by Lilienfeld in 1926 and then by Oskar Heil in 1934, no practical applications arose before the transistor effect was observed and explained by Shockley in 1947. A transistor is a semiconductor device that can amplify and switch electronic signals. It is the key component in practically all modern electronics.

Recent advancements in organic science induced the development of a broad range of devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) solar cells, and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). This has economic viability since they can be produced as low-cost, large-area, lightweight and more flexible devices than their inorganic counterparts.

Organic light-emitting field-effect transistors (OLETs) are an example of more integrated devices, combining the electrical switching functionality of a field-effect transistor and the capability of light generation into a single device. This is important because steps required to construct highly integrated opto-electronic systems of separate devices affect the simplicity of the system architecture and production cost.

Moreover OLETs offer an ideal structure for improving the lifetime and efficiency of organic light emitting materials by different driving conditions than standard OLEDs (see section \ref{sec:thinfilms}). Also they can achieve optimized charge-carrier balances (section \ref{sec:ambipolar_olets}).

In the progress article from \citet{Muccini} several recent advances of FET architectures to achieve light generation from different organic materials are reviewed. First it presents an overview of comparable devices, such as those based on silicon and direct-bandgap semiconductors. Next the emission properties of single-walled carbon nanotube FETs are discussed. They have potential for use as highly integrable nanoscale light sources. OLETs based on organic thin films are discussed for their low production cost and ease of integration on virtually any substrate and \textbf{something about uni-/ambipolar olets}.
